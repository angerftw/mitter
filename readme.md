### Version
> Mitter beta has been tested in my several personal projects.

### Techs

Mitter uses a number of open source projects for its interface to work properly:

* [Twitter Bootstrap] - The most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web
* [jQuery] - jQuery JavaScript Library
* [select2] - a jQuery based replacement for select boxes
* [Eonasdan/bootstrap-datetimepicker] - Date/time picker widget based on twitter bootstrap
